# Welcome

This is my personal portfolio. Getting back to HTML and CSS after a long time has been fun. Please note it still needs perfecting, but I feel proud of the job done at the moment.

As my previous projects and jobs are not my strengths (since I don't have any), I have focused on my life and how I have grown and learnt over the years. Therefore, this is not a conventional-structured protfolio, but I feel it describes me best.  

Enjoy it!
Sergio
